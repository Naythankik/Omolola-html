      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p class="description">
        I am <span class="name">Nathaniel Abolarin Okikiola</span>. I am a boy.
        Born on the 10<sup>th</sup>
        of September. I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and
        constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward.
        I'm not comfortable with settling, and I'm always looking for an
        opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. I am results-oriented,
        constantly checking in with the goal to determine how close or how far
        away we are and what it will take to make it happen. I find this
        pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the rest of the team.
